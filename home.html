            <p>Welcome to a site that is all about you! (and me a bit). I love you so much and I wanted this 
                to be a place where we could document our memories over the course of our lives together. I am
                extremely lucky and grateful to have someone as amazing as you in my life. I still can't believe that 
                you're with me. Big win on that one. I miss you so much and cannot wait to see you! 
                Love, Lukas.
            </p>
