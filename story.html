            <h2>The Beginning</h2>
            <p>Our journey began when I first laid my eyes on you in grade 8.
                I was waiting to be picked up from school when I saw the most 
            beautiful girl. I knew at that moment that I had to know you.
            Little did I know that u would eventually become the most important 
            person in my life. Quite rudely, you then broke up with me after a month
            of dating... Life.</p>

            <h2>The Middle</h2>
            <p>In tenth grade I grew close to you on our trip to South Africa.
                I tried so hard to be perfect for you and to be a person that you 
                would want to be with. After a few weeks of adoring you, I was filled with
                joy when I got a second chance with the girl of my dreams. For the 
                remainder of the year, I loved spending every week with you.
                That was the first time that I had connected with someone in such a meaningful way.
                I fucked it up tho... Payback.

            <h2>The Beginning of the Rest of our Lives</h2>
            <p>After a year apart, I realized the huge mistake that I made and that I was still
                in love wiht you. My feelings had not faded and I was missing out on the opportunity
                to love someone like never before. At this point I had matured emotionally and I
                was ready to fully commit to loving you. We have become extremely close to one another
                and I have been lucky to love you with all of my heart.
